## Project Description

This project is a recreation of the popular game Battleship. As a part of the Odin Project curriculum, this project exposed me to the basics of TDD using Jest.
Players have the option to play against a computer or another player. To ensure the game is played fairly between two people, I've implemented a 'pass device' screen that hides the gameboards for 3 seconds after a player takes their turn so the other player's board isnt revealed. 

A lot of the challenges I've faced in previous projects were no longer an issue since I added TDD to my workflow. I was able to focus on tasks and solve them faster than before. The idea when using TDD to get the code working no matter what and then focusing on refactoring increased my productivity a lot. Before I would get sidetracked with trying to come up with the best solution the first time around that I wasn't working at a productive pace. But during this project, I was able to work more efficiently and code more confidently.

Some things that I would like to implement in the future are a ship display to show the reamining ships throughout the game, a randomize button that would place
ships randomly if a player chooses, and finally a 'pass device' screen that players would need to click to remove.
